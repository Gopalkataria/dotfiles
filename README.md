# Hyprland dotfiles, with fedora based installation script 

*My hyprland dotfiles. based off of cachyos [https://cachyos.org/](https://cachyos.org/). mostly following a [gruvbox color pallete](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)*



## Installation

### Fedora 

- use install.sh as shown below. it updates the system, installs rpmfusion and required packages.
- please see the contents of install script before using it. I strongly recommend against running it blindly.  

``` bash
sudo ./install.sh 
```

### Arch 

you know how to do it, right ??

### other distros 

chekc the install script and follow equivalent steps for your distro. if not supported by hyprland, I cant do anything ( sorry ubuntu )
